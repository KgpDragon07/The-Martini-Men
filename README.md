# Our proposed solution:-

**Monitoring disasters using UAVs :** Drones equipped with camera sensors which produce aerial photos of the affected area could help us recognize unsteady conditions using Deep Learning techniques. Images collected are sent to the server for remote processing. A trained Deep Learning model (VGG architecture) will be deployed on the server which would help in the prediction part.

For example, in case of a flood :
In addition to spotting people in need of help, drones will be able to predict further flooding, and help provide estimates of how long certain areas would be underwater.


### Post Prediction: 
#### We divide our post prediction solution into three parts :-

1) **Recognizing high importance zones**, i.e. segregating and prioritising disaster affected area to send help in an efficient manner. 

    - **How it works** : We provide an offline group messaging platform, redType, to the people to communicate with first responders which helps the aiders assess the immediacy of the situation.

    - **Mesh Network** : To allow messages to be sent directly from device to device, users connect to all nearby devices by creating a localized mesh network which is achieved using the Android Nearby Connections API.

    - The frequency of messages, i.e. the mesh network traffic, received by first responders in nearby zones would in turn give us the estimate of the measure of importance of a particular disaster affected region.

2) **Aid Transfer Optimization**, i.e. deciding on Aid stations where thereâ€™s sufficient help available and from where sending support would be best.

    - **How it works** : Given a network of Aid stations, we keep a track of the quantity of emergency supplies available, focussing mainly on those which are closest to high importance zones(say layer 1). Next, we identify Aid stations closest to the layer 1 stations(say layer 2) and steer all their aids towards the nearest (optimal) layer 1 stations.

    - Priority will be given to Aid stations which have support available and are closest to the Layer 1 stations and/or affected areas

3) **ETA with the help of redType** : i.e. provide an estimate of when help will reach the victims based on the developed conditions of the surroundings.
    - It would take into account the preparation time at each Aid station, mode of transport used and the distance (taking the most preferable route) from the affected area, given the circumstances.
    - The estimate could also help the first responders know how much time they would take to reach the victims and speeden their actions accordingly
